## Onboarding Flow Design for a Weight Loss Application

**General Concept:**
This onboarding flow is designed to gather comprehensive user information (anthropometrics, goals, habits, psychological profile, medical aspects) to create a personalized weight loss plan. A key feature is the presentation of this tailored plan *before* user registration to increase the motivation to create an account and thereby improve conversion rates. The flow incorporates direct questions, informational screens, and intermediate screens that dynamically show the user how their program is being built based on their input.

**General Implementation Recommendations:**

1.  **Program State Management:** All information collected during onboarding should be temporarily stored (e.g., in app state or local storage) and used to dynamically update the "PROGRAM" block on intermediate screens and for final calculations. Upon successful registration, this data must be saved to the server and linked to the user's account.
2.  **Design and UX:**
    *   Maintain a consistent visual style (background color, fonts, button styles).
    *   Selection buttons should be large enough for easy tapping.
    *   Progress indication (the "PROGRAM" block) is vital for user engagement.
    *   Icons make the interface more user-friendly and understandable.
    *   Recommended options should be visually highlighted.
3.  **Calculations:** All calculations (BMR, TDEE, calorie deficit, weight loss rate, goal date projection, nutrient targets) must be based on accepted formulas (e.g., Harris-Benedict or Mifflin-St Jeor) and user inputs.
4.  **Flexibility:** Provide users with the ability to go back to previous steps (a "Back" button).
5.  **Localization:** If the app will be available in multiple languages, all text content must be prepared for localization.
6.  **Testing:** Thoroughly test all logic branches, especially conditional transitions and calculations.
